 Assignment 1 file(s)

This time you can submit in groups of Max 3.

Recommendations: Look for a decent computational machine (e.g. notebooks.csc.fi) and/or check information about libraries for parallelization in python (e.g. multiprocessing).

    Download the groceries.csv file from itslearning (also the file is in the folder homework inside the zip of this lecture)

Warning!

The baskets in this file are presented for each line of the file:

citrus fruit,semi-finished bread,margarine,ready soups tropical fruit,yogurt,coffee ...

So, you have to modify the code for reading the file properly!

 

    Find the frequent pair of items (2-tuples) using the na√Øve, A-priori and PCY algorithms. For each of these compare the time of execution and results for supports s=10, 50, 100. Comment your results.

    For the PCY algorithm, create up to 5 compact hash tables. What is the difference in results and time of execution for 1,2,3,4 and 5 tables? Comment your results.

    Find the final list of k-frequent items (k-tuples) for k=3,4 and 5. Experiment a bit and describe the best value for the support in each case. Warning: You can use any of the three algorithms, but be careful, because the algorithm can take too long if you don't chose it properly.

    Using one of the results of the previous item, for one k (k=3,4 or 5) find the possible clusters using the 1-NN criteria. Comment your results.

Deadline: 11.02.2021 at 23:59. Important: The jupyter notebook must show the results.

If you submit as a group be sure to state clearly who did what at the beginning of the notebook.
