> HW5_q2: From the shopping list, using at least two different methods find the pair of frequent items, create a weighted network for each method, using the support threshold as weight.

> HW3_q1: From the abstracts dataset, using three different similarity thresholds (e.g. 0.5, 0.8, and 0.95), create an unweighted network from the obtained similar pairs (use MinHashing or LSH) for each threshold.
