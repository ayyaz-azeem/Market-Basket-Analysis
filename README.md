> HW5_q2: From the shopping list, using at least two different methods find the pair of frequent items, create a weighted network for each method, using the support threshold as weight.

> HW3_q1: Find the frequent pair of items (2-tuples) using the naÃ¯ve, A-priori and PCY algorithms. For each of these compare the time of execution and results for supports s=10, 50, 100. Comment your results.

> HW3_q2: For the PCY algorithm, create up to 5 compact hash tables. What is the difference in results and time of execution for 1,2,3,4 and 5 tables? Comment your results.
